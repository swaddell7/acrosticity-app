# What's For Dinner

* I designed this app for users to have a place to search recipes from all over the internet. What's For Dinner allows the user to search by keyword in order to find a recipe that they like from multiple platforms, see the ingredients included in that recipe, and from there, navigate to the source page in order to find instructions on how to make the recipe. Each search includes the ingredients, the yield of the recipe, and the calories in each serving. Happy cooking!

# Features I Worked On

* Implementing a search feature that allows users to search recipes by keyword.

* Design of the content cards for recipes. 

# Technologies

* Built with React.

* CSS was used to help with styling.
